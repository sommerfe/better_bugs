# Better Bugs

A simple browser extension to help you create better bug reports.

Install it in your browser.
Click on the Better Bugs icon to open the extension.
Fill in a comment and push the button "Create Report" to create your bug report.

This report will include a screenshot of your current page, system information including the current URL, operating system, browser, and browser version.
Also the comment you entered will be included in the report.

If you want to add the network logs to the report, the network tab of the developer tools must be open before you click the "Create Report" button. To do this you can right-click on the page and select "Inspect" and select the network tab or press `Ctrl+Shift+I` , `Shift+F12` or `Cmd+Option+I` on Mac.
The network logs will be in the `HAR` format which can be easily imported in a browser or other tools.
